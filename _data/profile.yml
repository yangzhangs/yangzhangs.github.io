  <p>
    I am currently an assistant professor in the College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology (NUDT), China.  
    I joined the <a href="https://www.trustie.net" target="_blank">Trustie Lab</a> at August 2013, advised by <a href="https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang:Huaimin" target="_blank">Prof. Huaimin Wang</a>. 
    I received my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from NUDT in September 2019. 
    From October 2016 to October 2017, I was a visiting student at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis), USA sponsored by the China Scholarship Council. 
    I currently lead the <strong>RESET</strong> research group (in short for <span class="text-hl">R</span>esearch on <span class="text-hl">E</span>cological / <span class="text-hl">E</span>merging / <span class="text-hl">E</span>fficient / <span class="text-hl">E</span>volutionary <span class="text-hl">S</span>oftware <span class="text-hl">E</span>ngineering <span class="text-hl">T</span>echnologies).
    Our work investigates the foundations, methods, and tooling that shape modern software development and operations, emphasizing intelligent automation, socio-technical ecosystem understanding, empirical analysis, and next-generation engineering practices.
    <!--My research interests include <span class="text-hl">empirical software engineering</span>, <span class="text-hl">mining software repositories</span>, <span class="text-hl">DevOps</span>, and <span class="text-hl">open source</span>.-->
  </p>

  <p>
    I like movie, music, and photography.
